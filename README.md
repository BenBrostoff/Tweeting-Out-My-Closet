Tweeting Out My Closet is a web based application that runs on Sinatra and was created by Dev Bootcamp students Katie Reiner, Sid Patel, Greg Knudsen, Christian Moon and Ben Brostoff. 

The app uses the Twitter API to grab the last 200 tweets of users and broadcast them to the world. Users can enter a gameplay mode wherein they rate tweets and guess the tweeter, or search for key terms in tweets of other users. Embarrassment ratings as well as scores of users in gameplay mode (+1 for correct guess, -1 for incorrect) are tracked on the homepage. 

We welcome recommendations and pull requests. I can be reached via email at ben.brostoff@gmail.com for any questions / comments.
